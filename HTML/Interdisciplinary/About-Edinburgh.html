          <h3>About Edinburgh</h3>
          <p>Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland, which is in southeastern Scotland. Edinburgh serves as the location of the Scottish parliament, the central authority of the Church of Scotland, and the residence of a Catholic Archbishop.</p>
          <p>Edinburgh contained an estimate of 459 366 residents as of 2011 and has an area of 264 square kilometres, which makes Edinburgh the second largest city in Scotland. King David I sometime in the early 12th century granted Edinburgh the status of a king’s/royal burgh.</p>
          <p>Which was a benefit that furthered trade by enabling Edinburgh to work as both a marketplace and as a centre for organized manufacturing especially of cloth. Edinburgh became a city in 1329 and became the capital city of Scotland after Perth in 1437.</p>
